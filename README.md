Hi, Interesting Word
=====================

Mappings for temporarily highlighting words.

Sometimes you're looking at a hairy piece of code and would like a certain
word or two to stand out temporarily.  You can search for it, but that only
gives you one color of highlighting.

* Use `<Leader>N` (where N is a number from 1-6) to highlight the current word or
  selection in a bright color.
* Use `<Leader>0` to clear the highlights.
