Hi, Interesting Word
=====================

Mappings for temporarily highlighting words.

Sometimes you're looking at a hairy piece of code and would like a certain
word or two to stand out temporarily.  You can search for it, but that only
gives you one color of highlighting.  Now you can use <leader>N where N is a
number from 1-6 to highlight the current word in a specific color.  Use
<leader>0 to clear the highlights.
